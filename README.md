# Nexus Design Fixes

Stuff here was tested on FF with the Tampermonkey & Stylus addons.

## Userscript Options
- Remove the "Popular Collections" thing which is just a waste if you never use collections or Vortex.
- Remove the needless game header part because holy hell, it wastes so much space.
- URL rewrite to remove `games/` from the game root pages which switches back to the old design. (I dunno how long the old design will remain, but this can switch back to it for now.)

## Userstyle Options
- Make the read notification in the new UI fade like the old UI. [Preview](Make%20Nexus%20Read%20Notifications%20Fade.png)
